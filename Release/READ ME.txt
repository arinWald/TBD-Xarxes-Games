------ CONTROLS -----
WASD -> Movement
SPACE -> Charge ball throw (up to 1.5sec)
SPACE RELEASE -> Throw ball
Ball is picked automatically if it is not being grab by any player

------ BUGS -----
- Ball Desync: At certain moments in the game, we believe that depending on the inputs, the ball becomes desynchronized, but we think it's because we haven't yet implemented the checks for sending and receiving the packets.

----- OTHER CONSIDERATIONS -----
Main scene to run is Lobby, where each player can choose between creating a server or join one
